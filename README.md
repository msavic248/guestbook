# Create T3 App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

## [Guestbook App](https://guestbook-sigma.vercel.app)

Users can login with Discord to leave a message on the guestbook. This application was created using these below resources:

- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

### What I learned

- Setting up a PostgreSQL database on Railway
- Authentication with Discord and NextAuth
- Backend using tRPC for API layer and Prisma for connecting and querying database
- Deploying to Vercel
